### Technologies and Components Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Hardware**:
  - Microcontroller (Arduino or Raspberry Pi)
  - Motor driver modules
  - Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection
  - Infrared sensors for line-following capabilities
- **Software Libraries**: ROS (Robot Operating System), Arduino libraries for sensor handling

## 🛠 My Contribution to the Project

During the development of Vagabond the Rover, I contributed to the **hardware setup** of the rover, focusing on:

- **Component Assembly**: Organized and assembled key components, including sensors, motor drivers, and the microcontroller.
- **Wiring and Circuit Design**: Ensured stable connections, power distribution, and circuit integration for optimal sensor and motor function.
- **Chassis Structuring**: Assisted in designing the rover’s chassis to ensure durability and functionality across different terrains.

## 📂 Repository Contents

The repository is structured to include all necessary files for understanding and replicating the project.

- `code/`: Contains the complete source code, including movement algorithms, sensor integration, and control logic.
- `design/`: CAD files and design documentation, detailing the physical structure of the rover.
- `images/`: Photos and diagrams of Vagabond the Rover during different stages of development.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project, workshop details, and instructions for replication.

## 🚀 Project Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
To set up and test **Vagabond the Rover**, ensure you have the following:

- **Hardware**:
  - Microcontroller (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
  - Sensors (ultrasonic, infrared)
  - Motors and motor drivers
  - Power supply

- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE or Python environment
  - ROS installed (for advanced control and sensor data processing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Vagabond-the-Rover.git
    cd Vagabond-the-Rover
    ```

2. **Upload Code to Microcontroller**:
   - Open `code/main_code.ino` in the Arduino IDE, select the correct board and port, and upload the code.

3. **Setup ROS Environment** (if using ROS):
   - Navigate to the `ros/` folder and follow instructions in `ros/README.md` to configure the robot’s ROS environment.

## 💻 Running the Rover

After the installation and setup, you can test the rover’s functionality:

1. **Obstacle Detection**:
   - Place the rover in an environment with obstacles. Run the `obstacle_avoidance.py` script to test obstacle detection and autonomous navigation.

2. **Line Following** (if equipped with IR sensors):
   - Use `line_following.py` to have the rover follow a pre-determined path marked by lines.

3. **Remote Control Mode** (optional):
   - Connect a Bluetooth module and use the remote control script to navigate Vagabond manually.

## 📊 Performance and Testing

### Testing Methods
The rover was tested in several scenarios to ensure performance and reliability:

- **Obstacle Courses**: Various obstacles placed to test real-time detection and avoidance.
- **Speed and Accuracy**: Analyzed for response time and accuracy in both open and closed environments.
- **Battery Efficiency**: Evaluated for duration under continuous operation.

### Results
The rover demonstrated efficient obstacle avoidance and maintained stable performance over multiple testing sessions. Further improvements can be made in real-time decision algorithms and adaptability to complex terrains.

## 📈 Key Learnings and Outcomes

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in:
- **Embedded Programming**: Writing efficient code for real-time control.
- **System Integration**: Integrating multiple sensors and components to work cohesively.
- **Problem Solving**: Adapting solutions based on environmental challenges.
